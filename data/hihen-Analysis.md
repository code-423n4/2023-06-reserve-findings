## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
Automated tools and static analysis techniques were employed to detect common vulnerabilities and coding errors.
Extensive testing was conducted to validate the functionality and reliability of the system.

## Architecture recommendations
Reserve is a complex system, the design and implementation of the current project architecture is already very good.
However, as the system becomes more complex, adopting the [ERC-2535: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) may make the system clearer and easier to maintain.

## Codebase quality analysis
The codebase demonstrates a high level of quality, adhering to best practices and standards.
Proper code documentation, including comments and function descriptions, contributes to the clarity and understandability of the code.
